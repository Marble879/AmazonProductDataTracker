# AmazonPriceTracker

## What are you going to make?

This project will take a link to a product on amazon, scrape the website, and then return details on the product, such as the current price, and if there are any discounts.

## Why will you make it?

Rather than having to open the web browser, go to amazon, and search for the product etc, this sotware could be opened from the desktop, and show information on the products that have been set to be tracked.

## How are you going to make it?

This will be made by using java, the jsoup library and Gradle.
